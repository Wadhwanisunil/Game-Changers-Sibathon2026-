Phishing URL Detection using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning-based system that detects whether a given website URL is legitimate or phishing. It analyzes various URL and website-related features such as IP address usage, HTTPS status, domain age, and redirection behavior to classify the website as safe or malicious. The goal of this project is to enhance cybersecurity by providing an automated way to identify phishing attacks and protect users from online fraud.
